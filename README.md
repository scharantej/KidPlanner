## Flask Application Design for Kids Planner

### HTML Files
- index.html:
    - Main page, displaying the input fields for adding activities and a table to display the schedule.
- schedule.html:
    - Displays the saved schedule, including music, sports, and homework activities.

### Routes
**@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])**
- Handles the index page.
- GET: Renders the index.html file.
- POST: Receives user inputs for activity details, validates them, and saves them in a data structure (e.g., a list or database).

**@app.route("/schedule", methods=["GET"])**
- Handles the schedule page.
- GET: Renders the schedule.html file and populates it with activities stored in the data structure.

### Data Structure for Activities
- Consider a simple list of dictionaries to store activity data, with each dictionary representing an activity.
- Each dictionary should include keys such as "name", "time", "activity_type" (music, sports, homework).

### Flow of the Application
- Users access the index.html and enter activity details.
- Upon submitting the form, the POST route processes the inputs, validates them, and saves the activities to the data structure.
- Users can then access the schedule.html to view the saved schedule, which is dynamically generated based on the activities stored in the data structure.

### Additional Considerations
- Input validation to ensure correct data entry.
- Error handling to provide feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or other issues.
- Extension of the data structure to support multiple children or families with separate schedules.
